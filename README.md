Vulpes is an excellent, user-installable bot for Discord that offers a wide range of extra commands for users. To use Vulpes on a server, you must have the "Use External Apps - Allow apps that members have added to their account to post messages" permission enabled for your role. If this permission is disabled, you can still access Vulpes commands by typing "/" and clicking on the Vulpes logo (copyvictor is provided!)ï»¿. Unfortunately, you won't be able to use the search function. Additionally, if you don't have permission to use external apps, the bot's response will be ephemeral (only visible to you). However, this restriction does not apply to DMs, GCs, Clans, or ExtChan!
